          <p>I have a strong interest in both psychology and IT, with psychology being a personal hobby that I intend to
            continue exploring. However, I ultimately chose ICT (IT) because I've always been curious about how software
            and computers work, desiring to comprehend the 'behind-the-screen' processes and the functionality of
            computer commands. Additionally, I'm eager to delve into cognitive science.</p>
          <p>In today's fast-paced world, choosing a field of study can be an exhilarating yet challenging decision. For
            me, this decision was a fascinating exploration of two diverse worlds: psychology and information and
            communication technology (ICT), with a particular interest in the inner workings of software and its
            profound connection to the human mind.</p>
          <p>Psychology, with its captivating study of human behavior, cognition, and emotions, has been a personal
            passion of mine. This fascination remains a treasured part of my life, one that I intend to nurture and
            explore in my free time.</p>
          <p>My curiosity extended to the inner workings of software and computers, the 'behind-the-screen' processes
            where lines of code bring technology to life. This curiosity ultimately led me to choose ICT as my academic
            path.</p>
          <p>My interests also include cognitive science, which explores the parallels between computers and the human
            brain. Understanding this connection is vital in our ever-evolving digital age, as it helps create
            technology that is intuitive, accessible, and beneficial for everyone.</p>
          <p>By merging software development, ICT, psychology, and cognitive science, I aim to drive transformative
            advancements in technology. My goal is to contribute to the creation of human-centric, innovative
            technological solutions that simplify our lives and enhance our well-being.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, while psychology remains a cherished interest, my choice to specialize in ICT signifies a
            deliberate focus on the dynamic, ever-evolving world of information and communication technology. By
            harmonizing my passion for understanding the 'behind-the-screen' processes with my curiosity about the human
            mind, I aim to make a meaningful impact on the digital landscape and contribute to the betterment of society
            through technology.</p>
