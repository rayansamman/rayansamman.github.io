                        <h2>Strengths</h2>
                        <p>I'm really good at solving problems, especially in programming. I can also communicate well
                            with
                            others,
                            which makes teamwork easier. Additionally, I'm a logical thinker and love to learn, which
                            helps
                            me understand
                            things systematically.

                        <h2> Weaknesses</h2>
                        <p> often leading me to seek perfection in my work. Sometimes, I overthink things, wanting
                            everything to be perfect I can be quite critical of my own performance, which sometimes
                            results
                            in spending more time on tasks than necessary. Another challenge I also tend to have lots of
                            ideas but struggle to stick to just one. </p>

                        <h2> Opportunities</h2>
                        <p> I see opportunities in my problem-solving skills. They can help me handle complex tasks and
                            find
                            creative solutions. I'm working on balancing my overthinking to do thorough work without
                            delays.
                            My many ideas could lead to creative solutions. However, I need to avoid letting
                            perfectionism
                            cause procrastination or missed deadlines.

                        <h2>Threat </h2>
                        The risk with overthinking is missing out on time-sensitive opportunities due to delays.
                        Struggling
                        to stick to one idea might lead to a lack of focus and reduced productivity. If perfectionism
                        isn't
                        managed, it could cause procrastination and missed deadlines, which is a threat to my academic
                        or
                        career progress. I'm actively working on these to avoid these threats
